All the concepts have been applied on California Housing Dataset.

Starting from data preparation to outlier and missing values treatment.

Then building linear, logistic and neural network models along with performance comparison of the models.

Also tuning hyperparameters while visualizing the data representation, and using regularization to tackle bias-variance tradeoff.
